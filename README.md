People Counting Application
===========================


This application is used to count persons on board and create an overview afterwards


How it works
------------

The applications seperates people by boats. Every Boat that is created has a randomly generated name.


The Application is running locally on the ship. To start the application, you type the IP/peoplecounter into your browser.

It opens the counting forms in which you can fill in the persons details.

If you want to see the results, click on "overview" in the top navi. If all persons left the ship, you can click on "file to archive" and the boat will not be shown in the dropdown anymore


Trouble Shooting
----------------

Can't connect to the application, no error code

	1. Is the Server running?

	2. Is the Client connected to the network
